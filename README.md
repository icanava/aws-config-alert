# üîê AWS Security Misconfiguration Detection

A real-time alert system built with AWS Config, Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge to detect public S3 buckets and notify security contacts automatically. This serverless solution simulates a common misconfiguration scenario and responds with <30s alert latency.

## üß∞ Stack Used

- **AWS Config** ‚Äì Detects public S3 bucket misconfigurations
- **EventBridge** ‚Äì Triggers Lambda when a rule is violated
- **Lambda (Python)** ‚Äì Parses the Config event and sends an SNS alert
- **SNS** ‚Äì Sends real-time email notifications
- **CloudTrail** ‚Äì Captures API activity and changes
- **S3** ‚Äì Used to simulate a misconfigured bucket with public ACL

## üõ† Deployment Walkthrough

### 1. Enable AWS Config  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95a13fa3-011c-449a-90a7-973fdcfb7b7c" alt="AWS Config Dashboard" height="600"/>

Enabled AWS Config to record resource configurations and compliance history. Logs are delivered to an S3 bucket.

---

### 2. Add Managed Rules  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cfb5b84-db6f-45b6-bcc3-c9a02c1a83d7" alt="Security Rules" height="600"/>

Added:
- `s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`
- `s3-bucket-public-write-prohibited`

These rules monitor S3 bucket access and flag public buckets as **NON_COMPLIANT**.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:
At one point, the S3 rules (s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited, etc.) weren‚Äôt flagging violations as expected. I discovered that public bucket policies don‚Äôt trigger these rules ‚Äî only ACLs do. The fix was to enable ACLs and manually assign public permissions via the Access Control List (ACL) editor, not just through a policy.

### 3. Create SNS Topic  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70cca090-b827-4331-bfb3-6a8c8a3b6632" alt="SNS Topic" height="600"/>

Created an SNS topic called `SecurityAlertsTopic` for delivering real-time email notifications.

---

### 4. Confirm Email Subscription

Subscribed and confirmed an email address to receive alerts from the SNS topic.

---

### 5. Create Lambda Function  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff4d27f3-fab1-4190-b516-f94b23b754f7" alt="Lambda Security Function" height="600"/>

Wrote a Python Lambda function that:
- Parses incoming AWS Config violation events
- Extracts relevant details (bucket name, rule, region)
- Publishes an SNS alert

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:
The Lambda function initially wasn‚Äôt alerting even though test events worked. I eventually found out the issue was a hardcoded bucket name mismatch in the test JSON ‚Äî I had "test-bucket-name" instead of my actual resource ID. Once corrected, alerts flowed properly on manual trigger.

---

### 6. Update IAM Role  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd7b8cc-9e31-4730-af73-777b9135c565" alt="Lambda IAM Role" height="600"/>

Added `sns:Publish` permissions to the Lambda execution role using the `AmazonSNSFullAccess` policy.

---

### 7. Create EventBridge Rule  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64d21e2c-918b-4ba4-af43-4e395f3a401c" alt="Event Rule" height="600"/>

Configured EventBridge to listen for `Config Rules Compliance Change` events where complianceType is `NON_COMPLIANT`. Target = the Lambda function.
üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:
Despite the rule being created correctly, no alerts were being triggered automatically. After testing, I confirmed that EventBridge only fires when AWS Config sends a new compliance evaluation event. Some AWS Config rules (especially S3 public ACL rules) can be flaky or delayed, so for validation, I simulated a real event using an actual compliance violation JSON.
---

### 8. Simulated Violation & Email Alert  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ece1a8d3-0fed-4946-b1b7-f0ecb022079d" alt="Email Alert" height="400"/>

Simulated a public bucket violation via Lambda test event using real-world AWS Config JSON. SNS delivered a real-time alert to the subscribed email inbox.
